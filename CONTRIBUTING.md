# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all contributions, including bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug Reports & Feature Requests:** Open an issue describing the bug or feature in detail.
- **Documentation:** Help improve or expand our documentation by submitting changes.
- **Code Contributions:** Submit a pull request (PR) for new features, bug fixes, or improvements.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Forking or Branching

You can contribute in two main ways:
- **Forking:** Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and push your changes to a branch on your fork. This is the preferred workflow for external contributors.
- **Branching (for collaborators):** If you have direct write access, create a new branch from the latest `main` (or `develop`, if used) branch. Name your branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/awesome-feature` or `fix/typo-in-readme`).

### 2. Making Changes

- Make sure your branch is up to date with the latest `main`.
- Make atomic, logically separated commits.
- Write clear commit messages describing your changes.

### 3. Submitting a Pull Request

- Push your branch to GitHub.
- Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch (unless otherwise specified).
- Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any relevant issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- If your PR is not ready for review, mark it as a draft.

### 4. Code Review

- Participate in the review process by responding to feedback and making necessary changes.
- Ensure that all checks (e.g., CI, tests, linting) pass before requesting a review.

## Additional Guidelines

- Follow the project's coding style and conventions.
- Add or update relevant tests if applicable.
- Update documentation if your changes require it.
- Be respectful and constructive in your communication.
